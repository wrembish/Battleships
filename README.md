# Battleships

## Credit 
* Followed along to the following tutorial and the part 3 listed in the description
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpAwggQJPUQ&t=0s&ab_channel=codeSTACKr
* Used the following to allow drag and drop events to work on mobile

## improvements I've made so far
* Made it so you can't start single player without placing your ships
* Made it so the game would no longer let you place the ships overlapping each other
* Made it so the game wouldn't register a move if it was a square that you already clicked on
* Made it so the drag and drop for placing ships worked on mobile as well
* Improved the computer AI to try to track down the ship when it gets a hit
* Fixed the game allowing you to click a square after the computer already won

## Planned Improvements
* Add a queue when current server is full to
* Add a spectator mode to spectate the current multiplayer game
* Add Difficulties for singleplayer
  * Easy mode would be the game without my AI improvements
  * Maybe try to make the AI even smarter for a hard mode
