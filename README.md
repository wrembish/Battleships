## improvements I've made so far
* Made it so you can't start single player without placing your ships
* Made it so the game would no longer let you place the ships overlapping each other
* Made it so the game wouldn't register a move if it was a square that you already clicked on
* Made it so the drag and drop for placing ships worked on mobile as well
* Improved the computer AI to try to track down the ship when it gets a hit
  * Improved the tracking AI even further to try and track multiple ship if the computer hits more than one ship
* Added difficulty to Singleplayer mode with different levels of AI intelligence

## Planned Improvements
* Add a queue when current server is full to
* Add a spectator mode to spectate the current multiplayer game
